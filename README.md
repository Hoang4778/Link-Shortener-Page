# Link Shortener Page

## Description

This is the challenge on Frontend Mentor website to help people practice making good UI and replicating template based on requirements.

## Live version

The site is available via [this link](https://rest-api-country-2acae.firebaseapp.com/)

## Running the project on local machine

This is the simple project so all you need to do is download the source code and run the `index.html` in the `dist` folder with **Live server** (if you are using VS Code) or open the file to your browswer.

## Functions of the project

1. Simply paste or type in your URL that needs shortening and hit `Shorten it` or press `Enter`:

2. A list of generated links will be displayed for you to `copy`:

## Project status

This project is **complete** and available for referencing

## Learning outcome

These are some of the most significant things that I learned during the process of building it:
- The challenge only includes the designs for desktop and mobile devices but I made it flexible and lookable on most of the screen sizes. The tricky thing in this design is how to transform the boxex in the Features section when the screen size changes. I managed to make use of **CSS Grid** so it can be well laid out.
- The way to generate the shortened link is to send the request to the third-party API and retrieve the short version of the links for showing on the UI. The **fetching API** step is lesson learned every time. I had to give a good look on the data that got sent back and gather the right material for my site. Also I have to watch out for the amount of requesting time ruled on the API site.
- The language I used in this project is jQuery and Tailwind CSS, which gave me the interesting time to work with. I used jQuery before, the library is good for manipulating the DOM easier but it can only support me so far (You are welcome to disagree with me). About Tailwind, it is a learning curve for me. For a guy who loves **pure CSS** more than ever, it has never been a better time to create a bunch of customed class in my HTML. The tool is pretty good at designing mobile-first layout, but then again I had to configure for the sake of the design.

## Wrap up

To sum up, this is the good chance for me to improve the coding skill and train the eye for details, and then again: "Any practice is a good practice".
